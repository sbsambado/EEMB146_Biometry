Code for t-tests

What type of data is there, and what type of t-test is appropriate to go over in R


One- sample t-test
- compares mean of a random sample from a normal population with the population mean proposed in a null hypothesis
- Assumptions
  - variabels is normally distributed
  - the sample is a random sample
```{r one sample t-test}
bodytemp <- c(98.4, 99, 98, 99.1, 97.5, 98.6, 98.2, 99.2, 98.4, 98.8, 97.8, 98.8, 99.5, 97.6, 98.6, 98.8, 98.8, 99.4, 97.4, 100, 97.9, 99, 98.4, 97.5, 98.4)

# null hypothesis mean
mu0 = 98.6

t.test(bodytemp, mu = mu0)

```

Example: Paradise flying snakes
```{r 95% confidence interval for a mean}
# long way of finding one sample t-test
Y = c(0.9, 1.4, 1.2, 1.2, 1.3, 2, 1.4, 1.6) # samples
ybar = 1.375 # estimate mean
s = 0.324 # standard deviation
n = 8 # sample size

# find confidence intervals
lower = ybar - qt(0.975, df =7)* s/sqrt(n)
upper = ybar + qt(0.975, df =7)* s/sqrt(n)

# other helpful command
qt(0.975, df = 7)

# or just run this command
t.test(Y)
```

Example 1. Non Smoking Day (NSD)
- years are your replicates
- before NSD and on NSD are your pairs
- it does *not* assume that the individual values are normally distributed, only the differences

```{r paired t-test example 1}
year <- seq(87, 96, by = 1)
beforeNSD <- c(516,610,581, 586,554,632,479,583,445,522)
onNSD <- c(540,620,599,639,607,603,519,560,515,556)

# make data frame
NSDdata <- data.frame(year, beforeNSD, onNSD)

t.test(NSDdata$onNSD, NSDdata$beforeNSD, paired = TRUE)
```

Example 2: Bug spray
- individual is replicate
- left and right arm are paired
```{r one sample t-test with paired data}
# want to see if there's a difference between left and right arm that used different bug sprays
# counts are mosquito bites
person <- seq(1, 9, 1)
left <- c(4,3,12,1,8,20,12,6,17)
right <- c(2,0,8,2,2,15,5,0,18)
diff <- left - right

# applied a one sample t-test
t.test(diff, mu = 0)
```

Testing hypotheses about the difference in two means

*Two sample t-test compares the means of a numerical variable between two populations*
- varraince of both populations is equal
- both pops have normal distribution

Example 3: frog growth on diet A vs diet B
```{r two sample t-test}
A <- c(5,10,8,7,9)
B <- c(5,3,5,6,1,4)

t.test(A, B, var.equal = TRUE)
```

What happens when you compared means when variances are not equal?
*use Welch's t-test*
- compares the means of two normally distributed populations that have unequal variances
- procedure is same as standard 2-sample t-test, but different formulas are used to calculate the standard error and degrees of freedom

- one possible method for test statistic: the F test
  - put larger variance on  top in the numerator
  - F has two degrees of freedom, one for numerator and one for denominator
  - F test is very sensitive to its assumption that both distributions are normal
  - use F test to figure out if you can run a Welsch's t-test
    - if F > critical value then we can rejec the null hypothesis that the variances are equal
    
- another method is the Levene's test
  - F test will often falsely reject null hypothesis of equal variance if one population is not normal
  - Lavene's test is another test that can be used to test for unequal variances when samples are NOT strictly normal
  - assumption: distribution of variable is roughly symmetrical in both populations 
Example 4: Using frog diet data again
```{r Welch or standard two sample t-test}
A <- c(5,10,8,7,9)
B <- c(5,3,5,6,1,4)

# Welch two sample t-test
# more conservative, and less powerful than standard two sample t-test
t.test(A,B)

# Two sample t-test
# gives slightly lower p value, slightly more significant
t.test(A, B, var.equal = TRUE)
```

Topic 4: Data Transformations

Assumptions of two-sampled t-tests
- both samples are random samples
- both populations have normal distribution
- the variances of both populations are equal
  - or Welch's t-test when variances are not equal
  
Linear models often assume pop come from normal distribution vs binary distribution (generalized linear model i.e. count data 1/0)

What to do when the assumptions are not true?
- if sample sizes are large, sometimes the parametric tests work OK anyways
  ~ a statistical procedure is 'robyst' if the answer it gives is not sensitive to violations of the assumptions
- transformations
- non-parametric tests
- randomization and resampling

*Normal approximation*
- means of large samples are normally distributed
- paramtetric tests on large samples work relatively well, even for non-normal data
- rule of thumb - if n > ~ 50, the normal approx. may work

*Transformation*
- a data transformation changes each data point by some simple mathematical formula
  - used to make non-normal data normal
a. log- transformation
  - a lot of low values, few high points, right skewed
        Y' = ln[Y]
  - useful when:
    - variable is likely to be result of multiplication of various components
      - a,b vs. a*b
    - frequency distribution of data is skewed to the right
    - variance seems to increase as mean gets larger (in comparison across groups)
  - what to do with the 0s?
    - add small value to every data point,
    - but if there's a lot of zeros, this will make your data non-normal
```{r log transformations}

# example 1
biomass <- c(1.34, 1.96, 2.49, 1.27, 1.19, 1.15, 1.29)
hist(biomass)
lnbiomass <- log(biomass)
hist(lnbiomass)

# example 2
x1 <- c(68.52, 1.22, 0.57, 1.74, 22.74)
x2 <- c(19.19, 18.67, 36.74, 31.15, 0.67)

x1log <- log(x1)
x2log <- log(x2)

## Two sample t-test
t.test(x1log, x2log, var.equal = TRUE)

## Welch two sample t-test
t.test(x1log, x2log)
```
b. arcsine
  - frequently used for proportions
      p' = arcsin[sqrt(p)]
c. sqaure-root
  - used on count data, when variance increases with mean
      Y' = sqrt(Y + 1/2)
d. square
e. reciprocal
f. antilog

*Rules for valid transformations*
- require the same transformation be applied to each individual
- have one to one correspondence to original values
- have a montonic relationship with the original values (larger values stay larger)

*Choosing transformations*
- must transform each individual in the same way
- you CAN try different transformations until you ifnd one that makes the data fit the assumptions
- you CANNOT keep trying transformations until P < 0.05

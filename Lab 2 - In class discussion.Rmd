*What is due* 
## 'Homework to turn in', questions 1 - 3 at bottom of Lab 2 PDF on Gauchospace
# Due as a HTML or PDF file before 11:59 PM on April 15th

```{r}
# upload data 

# first install package 'readr'
install.packages('readr')
# call package in with library
library(readr)

library(readr)
caffeine <- read.csv("~/Desktop/caffeine.csv")
#View(caffeine)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
